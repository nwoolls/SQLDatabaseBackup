Windows Azure SQL Database Backup Utility
=========================================

This utility will take a copy of your SQL Database, and once the copy has completed, will make a backup of the database to blob storage using the bacpac format.

Please supply for following command line arguments:

```
    -server [SQL Database server (without .database.windows.net)]
    -database [database to back up]
    -databasecopy (optional) [The name of the temporary copy database, defaults to database_copy]
    -user [SQL Database username]
    -pwd [SQL Database password]
    -storagename [Blob Storage account name]
    -storagekey [Blob Storage account key]
    -container (optional) [Blob storage container to use, defaults to sqlbackup]
    -datacenter [The data center where the database (not storage account) is located]
        (westeurope | southeastasia | eastasia | northcentralus | northeurope | southcentralus | eastus | westus)
	-cleanup 
```

Example usage:

```
SQLDatabaseBackup.exe 
    -server nevixxs 
    -database mydb 
    -user username 
    -pwd password 
    -storagename storageaccount 
    -storagekey dmASdd1mg/qPeOgGmCkO333L26cNcnUA1uMcSSOFM... 
    -datacenter eastasia
	-cleanup
```

### How it works

The backup process is not transactionally consistent, so the utility creates a copy of your database, and then uses the Azure backup API to copy that database to a bacpac file in Blob Storage.

The database copy will be deleted when the utilty starts, if it already exists.

Please ensure that a 'sqlbackup' container exists in your storage account (or specify a different value using -container), otherwise the backup API will throw an error.

The bacpac file will have the date and time of the backup appended to the name, allowing you to keep a history of backups.
